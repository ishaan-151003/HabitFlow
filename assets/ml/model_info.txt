# HabitFlow ML Models

This directory will contain TensorFlow Lite models for habit prediction and analysis.

For the MVP version, we're using rule-based predictions instead of full ML models to reduce complexity.

Future ML models will include:
1. Habit drop-off prediction
2. User clustering for personalized recommendations
3. Optimal habit timing prediction
4. Habit correlation analysis 

HabitFlow ML Models Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the ML models that will be used in the HabitFlow app.
In a production environment, this would be replaced with actual TFLite model files.

Future ML model assets:
- habit_prediction.tflite - Model for predicting habit completion likelihood
- streaks_analysis.tflite - Model for analyzing streak patterns
- recommendation_engine.tflite - Model for suggesting habit improvements
